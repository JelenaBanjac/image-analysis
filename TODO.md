# TODO
[x] Augment data (rotation + translation)
[x] Split on test and training, implement F-folds
    [ ] Properly measure the accuracy
[ ] Experiment with more features (we can try with 3 and draw 3D plot)
[ ] Different classification methods
    [ ] SVM
    [x] LinearSVM
    [ ] GMM
[ ] Contour detection methods
    [ ] Curve Polygonalisation
    [ ] Morphological Skeleton
[ ] Implement
    [ ] Distance between two contours
    [x] Chain code (Freeman code)
        [ ] Fisher-Wagner algorithm
